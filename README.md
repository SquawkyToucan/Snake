# Snake

*** A few snake games, and maybe more ***

## Snake

*Classic, one player snake*

Drive your snake around and try and eat fruit, colliding with yourself is the only way to die.

## Two Player

*A multiplayer rendition of the game*

One player uses WASD, the other uses the arrow keys. Driving around, the goals are now to eat fruit - and kill each other.

**Points**

You can win points in two situations:

 - Eating fruit
 - Having an opponent crash into you or themselves

**Collision Rules**

Whoever's head hits the other snake is the loser. If the collision is head on, there is a tie-breaker:

1. Whoever is longer gets the points
2. If they are the same size, one will get the points at random

You get different amounts of points depending on the type of collision. If you have a clean, they run into you hit, you get the most points, then head on, then random. Of course, these are then multiplied by the amount of fruit you've eaten to encourage that as well.

You win at 5000 points.
